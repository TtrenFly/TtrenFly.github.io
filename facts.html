    <h1>Here are some fun facts</h1>
    <div class="column">
        <p>- The popular video game "Pokemon" prior to its worldwide release(Pokemon Red and Blue) struggled during it development due to compatibility issues,<br>
        then HAL Laboratory's president Satoru Iwata stepped in to assist.
            <br>
        He proceeded to analyze the entire source code, reorganised and restructured the original games<br>
        then created compression tool to fit the games on those tiny Gameboy cartridges

        - Did you realise hot and cold water sound diffirent?
        <br>
        try pouring cold water from a kettle, boil it and try again.
        <br>
        What you hear is the difference in viscosity,<br> 
        the hot water flows ever so slightly faster causing it to pour differently.
